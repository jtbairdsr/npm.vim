npm.vim makes it easy to run npm commands from Vim. It doesn't have any interesting features like errorlist integration yet.

Global Commands:

    :Npm <command> [options..]

Calls `npm <command> [options]`. Commands can be tab-completed.

Global Settings:

    g:npm_background = 0

If set to non-zero, runs all commands in background (so you lose their output).

    g:npm_custom_commands = []

If some NPM commands aren't being picked up, add them to this list.
